noose alpha-zero release notes

Please read the LICENSE file, it isn't very complicated.

The noose utility is a command-line tool which can check for new posts
on a news server, via NNTP, in the groups to which one is subscribed, or
read articles by article-number.

It was written so I could find out how many unread posts were in some
local usenet groups when I logged in, so I have no idea whether it
will cope well with a large volume of groups or not.

Compilation and installation should be as simple as ``make noose install''.
Installation destination can be changed by editing ``Makefile''.
If the compile fails on your favorite platform, email me about it.

I've compiled and used noose on a number of platforms, including:
OpenBSD/x86, OpenBSD/sparc, Debian Linux/x86, Debian Linux/axp.
I guess it would be of some amusement to me if one emailed me
telling me that one has successfully compiled and used it on
another platform.

There are a number of enhancements I had planned for it, mostly
implementing additional NNTP commands (to make it more like an
NNTP swiss army knife). However, my use for noose has now gone, (the
local usenet groups have been eliminated), so I don't expect to
be adding many features to it. If you use it and would like an
enhancement, and don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, feel
free to contact me via email.

If you're submitting patches or want to take over maintenance,
you should keep in mind that I want to keep noose as simple as
possible, but by all means contact me. I am also interested in
hearing about any enhancements made by others.
